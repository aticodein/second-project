# Titanic Passangers Data Dashboard 

This is a single page dashboard represents the data of the passengers of the Titanic. Users can hover over and click on charts and selectors,
to make their own selected groups and compare to an other group. 

This can bring forward facts about the survivors correlation to age, class and genders.

The page uses the D3.js library with the DC.js and crossfilter.js libraries to present the data via a series of bar and pie charts, keep the data analysis clear and simple.

The last bar-chart can be used to select similar age groups. This brings out facts about yunger or elder survivor rates.

## UX
 
 User experiences: easy to navigate to scroll down, last chart also horizontal scrolling. Clickable "Learn more" button for about the page and
 
 "Reset all Charts" button self-explained. Buttons always on top line to easy access. Charts individual explanatory can be invisible with click on book icon.

#### This mockup made on Balsamiq. I have tried tu use free version and lost a few images,
#### but this one is show the main concept of the dashboard was:
#### a heading , some explanation (Learn more button made later for same purpose), charts two rows, (side bar was left out later completly) and footer
 
## Features

### Current Features
###### Feature 1 - Top title Jumbotron with image of Titanic
* The top bar contains the name of the site and also a button that when clicked, resets all the filters back to their default values.
* The bar is fixed to the top of the page so even when the user scrolls down, the user can quickly and easily reset the filters at any point. This avoids the need for constant scrolling up and down the page.

###### Feature 2 - Footer
* Footer with Github link to the project repository and the original dataset. JS icon for thanks to Dave Laffan for all his help and advices.

###### Feature 3 - Introduction
* Learn more button for short explanatory and this text doesn't take up space on dashboard.

###### Feature 4 - Dropdown open and closed book icons
* When user is familiar with the charts representations can close the texts over the charts.


###### Feature 5 - Pie Chart

### Future adds on

###### Menubar
* Detailed menubar with more pages. Such as more history about Titanic and contact or/and sign up pages.

All user stories listed in the UX section above. 

## Deployment ####

The site was developed using the cloud9 IDE and uses git for version control which is then pushed to GitHub. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and deployed there from the master branch on GitHub.

[https://aticodein.github.io/second-project/](https://aticodein.github.io/second-project/)

To deploy this project, I took the following initial steps:
- From my GitHub page I clicked on 'Repositories' and selected the required repository, in this case 'superhero-dashboard'
- I then clicked on the 'settings' option, located on the top horizontal menu bar
- Next, I scrolled down the page to the GitHub Pages section and located the dropdown box under 'Source'
- From there I selected the 'master branch'
- These steps resulted in the finished site being deployed at [https://aticodein.github.io/second-project/], (https://aticodein.github.io/second-project/)
